// Event in javascript 

// HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
// When javascript is used in HTML pages, Javascript can "react" on these events.

// HTML Events
// An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does

// Here are some examples of HTML Events :
// An HTML web page has finished loading
// An HTML input field was changed
// An HTML Button was clicked
// Often, when event happens, you may want to do something

// Javascript lets you execute code when events are detected.

// 4 ways of writing events in Javascript:
// 1) Using inline event alert()
// 2) By calling a function (We already seem and most common way of writing)
// 3) Using Inline events (HTML onclick="" property and element.onclick)
// 4) Using Event Listeners (addEventListener and IE's attachEvent)


// Section 2: What is Event Object?
// Event object is the parent object og=f the event object.
// for example
// MouseEvent, focusEvent, KeyboardEvent etc


// Section 3: MouseEvent in JavaScript
// Event that occur when the mouse interacts with the HTML document
// belongs to the MouseEvent Object.


// Section 4: KeyboardEvent in JavaScript
// Event that occur when user presses a key on the keyboard,
// belongs to the KeyboardEvent Object.
